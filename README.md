# Consecutive Prime Sum Explorer

This project has a Python program that finds the largest prime number that can be made by adding up consecutive prime numbers. The sum must be less than a number you provide.

## Features
- Finds prime numbers using a quick method called the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
- Adds consecutive primes together.
- Tells you the largest prime that can be formed from those sums.

## Installation
To run this program, you need to have Python on your computer. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/KumarOm143/Consecutive_Prime_Sum_Explorer.git
   
## Usage
2. Run the program using Python. You will be asked to enter a number, and it will show you the largest prime that can be made from consecutive primes below that number.
   
## Example
When you run the program, you might see this:

Enter a number: 20

And it will give you this answer:

17

This means that 17 is the largest prime number less than 20 that can be made by adding consecutive primes.
